<p>The Neuroelectrophysiology Analysis Ontology (NEAO) defines a controlled vocabulary and conceptual representations of the typical processes involved in the analysis of neural activity data acquired using electrophysiology techniques.</p>

<p>Electrophysiology is a branch of physiology that studies the electrical properties of biological entities. The studies involve measurements of electric potentials and/or currents, as well as electrical manipulations (e.g. stimuli with electric pulses). Neuroelectrophysiology is the application of electrophysiology techniques to investigate the function of neural tissue.</p>

<p>Neuroelectrophysiology recording is the process of data acquisition, and it usually involves placing electrodes (of several configurations and types) into a preparation of neural tissue. The data will contain a representation of the voltages or currents in the preparation during the recording session, usually as a time series. The analysis requires specific methods to progressively process and transform the recorded data, which generate results and insights.</p>

<p>The scope of the NEAO aims to provide a comprehensive representation of neuroelectrophysiology data and analysis processes, standardizing the description of their properties and relationships. The NEAO does not provide a detailed representation of electrophysiology recording techniques, data acquisition methods/equipment, and experimental settings/subjects. The goal is to ensure a common representation of data analysis that can be used by tools to provide a detailed and semantically-enriched description of the processes involved.</p>
