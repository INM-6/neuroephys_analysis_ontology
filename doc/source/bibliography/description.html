<p>The individuals defined in this module are supposed to be imported by the <a href="../steps/index.html">steps</a> module when inserting bibliographic reference information into the classes.

<p>Each bibliography item is represented as an individual of the <a href="http://purl.org/spar/biro">biro:BibliographicReference</a> class that is related to the analysis steps (defined in the <a href="../steps/index.html">steps</a> module) through the <a href="../base/index.html#hasBibliographicReference">hasBibliographicReference</a> annotation property. Each individual has a <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/bibliographicCitation">dcterms:bibliographicCitation</a> property defining a string with the human-readable citation, and also a <a href="http://purl.org/spar/biro">biro:references</a> property pointing to resolvable URIs used to reach the resource.</p>
