<p>The classes in this module are subclasses of the <a href="../base/index.html#AnalysisParameter">AnalysisParameter</a> base class and are associated with the analysis steps (defined in the <a href="../steps/index.html">steps</a> module) through the <a href="../base/index.html#usesParameter">usesParameter</a> object property. These classes can provide semantic information to analysis parameters </p>

<p>The parameter entities control the behavior of the analysis step. For example, in a low-pass filtering step in the analysis, where a raw wideband signal is transformed to isolate the frequency components smaller than a cutoff frequency, the time series with the raw signal is the data input, and the low-pass frequency cutoff frequency value is a parameter.</p>

<p>A parameter is then represented by an individual associated with the <a href="../base/index.html#usesParameter">usesParameter</a> object property. This provides flexibility to describe a parameter in detail and make inferences based on semantic information. For example, a low pass filter setting of 250 Hz can be represented by two properties: one for the integer value <em>250</em> and another for the unit <em>"Hz"</em>. The representation adopted by NEAO enhances machine readability compared to a single string value like <em>"250 Hz"</em>. NEAO does not predefine specific properties for the <a href="../base/index.html#AnalysisParameter">AnalysisParameter</a> class, allowing the use of existing ontologies, such as <a href="https://qudt.org/">QUDT</a>, to describe physical quantities. Moreover, the value of <a href="../base/index.html#usesParameter">usesParameter</a> can be associated with the multiple classes derived from <a href="../base/index.html#AnalysisParameter">AnalysisParameter</a> that are defined in this module, providing semantic meanings (e.g., using the <a href="#LowPassFrequencyCutoff">LowPassFrequencyCutoff</a> class for a low-frequency cutoff parameter).</p>
