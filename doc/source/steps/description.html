<p>The main classes are subclasses of the <a href="../base/index.html#AnalysisStep">AnalysisStep</a> class (defined in the <a href="../base/index.html">base</a> module), and represent the different methods and procedures used in the analysis to generate new data or to perform specific operations aimed to transform or extract additional information from the input(s). The classes are organized in a taxonomy, and the lowest level of the hierarchy represent specific, fine-grained descriptions of a step used in the analysis.</p>

<p>Grouping classes are provided to identify analysis steps according to their semantic similarities. This is used to keep the fine-grained descriptions associated with specific analysis methods (e.g., a step that used either the Welch or multitaper method to compute the power spectral density) while providing the ability to identify the steps in a more general nature (e.g., a step that computed a power spectral density). The grouping classes are defined in the taxonomy hierarchy by subclasses, and also as classes inferred by reasoning with the <a href="#hasPurpose">hasPurpose</a> object property (that points to individuals of the <a href="#AnalysisPurpose">AnalysisPurpose</a> class, such as <a href="#FunctionalConnectivityPurpose">FunctionalConnectivityPurpose</a>) or data properties defining boolean values (e.g., <a href="#isBivariate">isBivariate</a>). Therefore, groupings across multiple semantic dimensions are available (e.g., bivariate analyses or functional connectivity analyses).</p>

<p>The information regarding the inputs and outputs can be associated with each step by the <a href="../base/index.html#hasInput">hasInput</a> and <a href="../base/index.html#hasOutput">hasOutput</a> object properties that point to individuals that represent data entities (using the classes defined in the <a href="../data/index.html">data</a> module).</p>

<p>The parameters used to control the behavior of the analysis step are defined with the <a href="../base/index.html#usesParameter">usesParameter</a> object property that points to individuals that represent specific parameters (using the classes defined in the <a href="../parameters/index.html">parameters</a> module).</p>

<p>The relevant bibliographic references are provided with the <a href="../base/index.html#hasBibliographicReference">hasBibliographicReference</a> annotation property that points to individuals of the <a href="#">biro:BibliographicReference</a> class (defined in the <a href="../bibliography/index.html">bibliography</a> module). This structures the specific information associated with the analysis step represented by the class, and helps to disambiguate the description of the diversity of methods that are available to analyze neuroelectrophysiology data. This would be the case, for example, of different algorithms and assumptions (e.g., computing the power spectral density using either the Welch or multitaper approach), and the evolution/modifications of a method (e.g., different computations of phase lag index estimates).</p>

<p>The details of the software code associated with each analysis step can be provided by the <a href="../base/index.html#isImplementedIn">isImplementedIn</a> object property, that points to individuals of the <a href="../base/index.html#SoftwareImplementation">SoftwareImplementation</a> class (defined in the <a href="../base/index.html">base</a> module).</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href="../base/index.html#hasSubstep">hasSubstep</a> object property is used to describe compound analyses. These analyses involve the execution of multiple smaller steps (substeps) that are associated with specific parameters and intermediary data inputs and outputs. The main compound process can point to other individuals of the AnalysisStep class using the <a href="../base/index.html#hasSubstep">hasSubstep</a> property. Therefore, the appropriate semantic information and description associated with either the compound analysis or each individual substep can be provided in the ontology.</p>
