<p>The NEAO design assumes that neuroelectrophysiology data analysis consists of a sequence of small, atomic steps, each performing a specific action to generate, transform, or characterize data.</p>

<p>For example, consider the example below illustrating the sequence of steps to plot the power spectral density (PSD) of a local field potential (LFP) time series recorded by an extracellular electrode implanted in a brain area and saved to a data file.

<p><img src="./images/concept.png" style="display: block; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; width: 900px; height: auto" /></p>

<p>First, the raw data is loaded from the file into a data structure containing the voltage time series acquired by the recording equipment. The LFP is the low-frequency component of the extracellular signal (e.g., below 250 Hz), so a low-pass filter with a 250 Hz cutoff is applied to obtain the LFP time series. The PSD is then computed from the filtered data, resulting in an array of power density estimates for various frequency values. This power spectrum can be plotted and saved to a file. In this example, each step takes input data, processes it, and produces output data, with parameters (e.g., the low-pass cutoff frequency for filtering) controlling each step.</p>

<p>We propose the NEAO to describe such scenarios: 

<p><img src="./images/NEAO_main.png" style="display: block; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; width: 700px; height: auto" /></p>

<p>NEAO is organized around the central <strong>AnalysisStep</strong> class to model the atomic steps of the analysis. This class represents any process that generates new data entities (e.g., generating artificial LFP data) or performs specific operations to extract additional information from existing data entities. These operations include data transformations (e.g., filtering the raw signal into the LFP) or computations of new, derived data (e.g., obtaining the PSD from the LFP signal). Thus, each analysis step either acts on existing data entities or produces new data.</p>

<p>Two additional classes complete the core of the ontology model: <strong>Data</strong> and <strong>AnalysisParameter</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Data</strong> class represents any entity containing information used during the analysis and serves as the input and output for analysis steps. It can represent data obtained from biological electrophysiology recordings or data generated or transformed during analysis steps. In the example of computing the PSD from an electrode signal, the raw signal time series, the filtered LFP time series, the resulting PSD estimate array, and the plot are all instances of the <strong>Data</strong> class.</p>

<p>The <strong>AnalysisParameter</strong> class represents information entities that control the behavior of an analysis step. These parameters do not provide data to the step but influence its output. In the example above, the filter step uses a 250 Hz low-frequency cutoff parameter to set the bandwidth of the output signal.

<div id="ambiguities">
<h3 class="list" id="ambiguities">Solving ambiguities in the description of neuroelectrophysiology data analysis</h3>

<p>To accurately describe neuroelectrophysiology data analysis, two key aspects must be considered:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Multiple complementary and overlapping analysis methods can be used to understand a feature of brain activity from the recorded data, with each method's strengths and limitations influencing the results. For instance, various algorithms can compute the PSD of recorded signals, each producing similar measures but with different interpretations based on characteristics such as their frequency resolution.</p></li>
    <li><p>The implementation of a specific analysis method can vary across different software tools, potentially leading to subtle differences in results even when using the same underlying method.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, a clear and unambiguous description of both the methodology and the software implementations is essential for reliable insights into neuroelectrophysiology data analysis. NEAO aims to address the ambiguities that can be present when describing the steps, data, and parameters during the analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Naming:</strong> NEAO introduces a controlled vocabulary for naming classes, which is associated with a clear description, to avoid confusion with similar terms. Moreover, each class has a clear label, alternative labels to account for synonyms, and common abbreviations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Code:</strong> NEAO structures details of the code executing an analysis step ensuring precise identification of software tools and their versions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bibliographic References:</strong> NEAO links analysis steps to specific publications ensuring clear identification of the methodâ€™s version and its detailed description.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="grouping">
<h3 class="list" id="grouping">Obtaining broader insights on the analyses by semantic groupings</h3>
<p>The main NEAO classes provide detailed descriptions of <em>specific</em> analysis steps, data, and parameters. One example of a specific step is the computation of a PSD using either the Welch or the multitaper method.</p>
<p>However, to gain broader insights, general information about the analysis must be available. For instance, instead of querying if an analysis step used a specific method for computing a PSD (such as the Welch or multitaper), one may be interested in identifying if the analysis step is part of a <em>category</em> of methods (that includes any method that computes a PSD).</p>
<p>NEAO provides classes that introduce those semantic groupings, organizing the information in relevant categories and allowing more generalized insights on the analyses.</p>
</div>

<div id="modules">
<h3 class="list" id="modules">NEAO organization</h3>
<p>The NEAO definitions are divided into submodules, each defining a small ontology associated with a single namespace.</p>
<p>The core model is defined in a base module, and each of the three main classes (<strong>AnalysisStep</strong>, <strong>Data</strong>, and <strong>AnalysisParameter</strong>) is expanded in additional modules.</p>
<p>The documentation for each submodule provides extended details on the implementation, and is accessible in the table below:</p>

<caption>Summary of similarities and differences between NEAO classes and classes provided in other ontologies</caption>
<thead>

<tbody>
<tr><td><a href="https://obi-ontology.org">Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI)</a></td><td>data transformation (OBI_0200000)</td><td>AnalysisStep</td><td>The OBI class fits the central concept by the NEAO <b>AnalysisStep</b> class, as a planned process that transforms input data into an output. However, the OBI class is broad in the domain of biomedical sciences. The specific subclasses defined in OBI encompass executing analyses with specific methodologies (e.g., mass spectrometry) or a few processes described in the many subclasses of NEAO <b>AnalysisStep</b> (e.g., <em>normalization data transformation</em>). Therefore, the NEAO <b>AnalysisStep</b> class is specific to processes in neuroelectrophysiology data analysis, and the overlap with the classes in OBI is not full.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>data item (IAO_0000027)</td><td>Data</td><td>The OBI class (imported from the Information Artifact Ontology - IAO) fits the central concept of the NEAO <b>Data</b> class. The subclass <em>measurement datum</em> represents data obtained from an experimental recording and it has a specific subclass to represent spike trains (<em>spike train datum</em>). Other subclasses represent different dimensions of data or elements that are described by the <b>AnalysisParameter</b> class in NEAO. For example, the subclass <em>data set</em> is an aggregation of other <em>data item</em> elements, a construct inexistent in NEAO. The <em>average data</em> subclass represents a computed average, which is aligned with the NEAO <b>Mean</b> class. Other classes are defined for specific data elements in biomedical sciences. Therefore, there are few overlaps with specific subclasses of <b>Data</b> defined in NEAO, and there is no representation for specific analysis outputs in neuroelectrophysiology. This difficults the description in cases where there is a mapping between specific data and methods, which is modeled in NEAO. For example, the <b>PhaseLockingValue</b> and <b>CorrectedImaginaryPhaseLockingValue</b> classes in NEAO are associated with one of the specific steps to perform the phase locking value analysis, which are defined as subclasses of <b>PhaseLockingValueAnalysis</b> in the taxonomy of NEAO <b>AnalysisStep</b>. This ontological representation is not available in OBI.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://edamontology.org">Ontology of bioscientific data analysis and data management (EDAM)</a></td><td>Operation (operation_0004)</td><td>AnalysisStep</td><td>The concept aligns with NEAO, especially with the <em>has input</em> and <em>has output</em> relationships to <em>Data</em> that are semantically similar to the model defined in NEAO. However, the subclass structure of the EDAM <em>Operation</em> class introduces some inconsistensies to the subclass structure of NEAO <b>AnalysisStep</b>. In EDAM, the <em>Data analysis</em> class defines the concept of applying an analytical method to the input, which is the core concept associated with many <b>AnalysisStep</b> subclasses in NEAO. For other transformations, EDAM defines the different branch <em>Calculation</em>, which encompasses operations such as dimensionality reduction and statistical computations. However the EDAM classs <em>Principal component analysis</em> is a subclass of <em>statistical calculation</em> and not <em>dimensionality reduction</em>, which is inconsistent with the classification in NEAO. Therefore, although the full set of <b>AnalysisStep</b> subclasses is expected to overlap with the concept of EDAM <em>Operation</em>, the taxonomy to provide semantic groupings differ between the two ontologies. Finally, there are no specific coverage for methods in neuroelectrophysiology. For example, the <em>Spectral analysis</em> class in EDAM groups methods for computing mass spectrometry spectra, which is unrelated to the scope of NEAO.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>Data (data_0006)</td><td>Data</td><td>The EDAM class aligns with the concept of NEAO. However, there are no subclasses related to neuroelectrophysiology, and the existing definitions are inconsistent. For example, <em>Spectrum</em> in EDAM refers to a measure from mass spectrometry, and is unrelated to the concept defined by the <b>PowerSpectralDensity</b> class in NEAO.</td></tr>
