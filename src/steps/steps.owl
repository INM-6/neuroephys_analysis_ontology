                               rdfs:comment """This module in the Neuroelectrophysiology Analysis Ontology contains classes that represent (atomic) steps in the analysis of neuroelectrophysiology data.

The main classes are subclasses of the AnalysisStep class (defined in the base module), and represent the different methods and procedures used in the analysis to generate new data or to perform specific operations aimed to transform or extract additional information from the input(s). The classes are organized in a taxonomy, and the lowest level of the hierarchy represent specific, fine-grained descriptions of a step used in the analysis.

Grouping classes are provided to identify analysis steps according to their semantic similarities. This is used to keep the fine-grained descriptions associated with specific analysis methods (e.g., a step that used either the Welch or multitaper method to compute the power spectral density) while providing the ability to identify the steps in a more general nature (e.g., a step that computed a power spectral density). The grouping classes are defined in the taxonomy hierarchy by subclasses, and also as classes inferred by reasoning with the hasPurpose object property (that points to individuals of the AnalysisPurpose class, such as FunctionalConnectivityPurpose) or data properties defining boolean values (e.g., isBivariate). Therefore, groupings across multiple semantic dimensions are available (e.g., bivariate analyses or functional connectivity analyses). 

The information regarding the inputs and outputs can be associated with each step by the hasInput and hasOutput object properties that point to individuals that represent data entities (using the classes defined in the data module).

The parameters used to control the behavior of the analysis step are defined with the usesParameter object property that points to individuals that represent specific parameters (using the classes defined in the parameters module).

The relevant bibliographic references are provided with the hasBibliographicReference annotation property that points to individuals of the BiRO BibliographicReference class (defined in the bibliography module). This structures the specific information associated with the analysis step represented by the class, and helps to disambiguate the description of the diversity of methods that are available to analyze neuroelectrophysiology data. This would be the case, for example, of different algorithms and assumptions (e.g., computing the power spectral density using either the Welch or multitaper approach), and the evolution/modifications of a method (e.g., different computations of phase lag index estimates). 

The details of the software code associated with each analysis step can be provided by the isImplementedIn object property, that points to individuals of the SoftwareImplementation class (defined in the base module).

Finally, the hasSubstep object property is used to describe compound analyses. These analyses involve the execution of multiple smaller steps (substeps) that are associated with specific parameters and intermediary data inputs and outputs. The main compound process can point to other individuals of the AnalysisStep class using the hasSubstep property. Therefore, the appropriate semantic information and description associated with either the compound analysis or each individual substep can be provided in the ontology."""@en ;

The multitaper method uses discrete prolate spheroidal functions (DPSS, also known as Slepian sequences) as tapers applied to the inputs. For the computation, a CPSD using the periodogram method is obtained for each pair of tapered signals. The DPSS functions are orthogonal, and therefore applying multiple DPSS tapers result in independent estimates of the CPSD. The final CPSD is obtained by averaging the CPSDs across all tapers. The multitaper method reduces variance and bias in the CPSD, and has a high frequency resolution. However, it is computationally expensive. The number of tapers used is passed as parameter, or estimated from the desired resolution."@en ;

It is based on the analysis of the cumulants of the population spike count. The test takes a population histogram as input data (i.e., a spike train time histogram computed across spike trains with the activity of distinct neurons). A null hypothesis that the third cumulant of the data is less than or equal to the maximized third cumulant for a correlation order is iteratively tested (with increasing orders of correlation).

It combines the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of each neuron to illustrate how their firing rates co-vary over time relative to the stimulus event. This helps in understanding the temporal correlation between the neurons.

The computation can produce three outputs:

* the peristimulus coincidence histogram (i.e., a histogram obtained from a cross-section along the main diagonal of the JPSTH matrix);

For the computation, the phase difference (angular distance) is obtained for all pairs of observations in the input (that can be represented as vectors in the unit circle, where the angle is the relative phase). The cosine of the angular distance (an estimate of the dot product of the vectors corresponding to each element in a pair) is computed for every pair, and the PPC estimate is obtained from the average of all pairwise dot products. With phase synchronization, the distribution of the pairwise dot products is centered around an average value, while without synchronization it will be distributed across the unit circle.

The computation involves fitting two separate autoregressive (AR) models to the input data and comparing their fit to determine if one time series can predict the other.

The first AR model is univariate, predicting the future values of one time series (e.g., the first) only from its past values. The second AR model is bivariate, predicting the future values of the first time series from its past values as well as the past values of the second time series. If the bivariate model reduces the variance of the residuals (ratio greater than 1), the GC value will be positive, indicating that the second time series Granger causes the first (directional GC estimate from the second to the first). The same method is used to predict the second time series from the first, yielding the directional GC estimate from the first to the second time series. The order of the AR model is defined as parameter, and optimal values can be estimated using optimization techniques."@en ;

Therefore, this hinders its capacity to detect changes in phase synchronization of small magnitude. The WPLI extends the PLI to weight the contributions of the phase leads and lags by the magnitude of the imaginary component of the cross spectral density. Therefore, these increases the power to detect changes in phase synchronization. The WPLI ranges between 0 and 1. A WPLI of zero means that there is no imbalance in the first time series leading or lagging the second (i.e., the total weight of all leading relationships is equal to the total weight of lagging relationships). A value greater than zero means an imbalance in the likelihood of leading or lagging. A WPLI of 1 indicates perfect phase locking, and that the first time series only leads or only lags."@en ;

However, the output will resemble the original input with respect to shape or physical units. In addition, the inputs can also be converted to other formats or representations that are needed for a particular analysis step. For example, spike trains can be discretized into small intervals (binning) or the dimensionality of the input can be reduced using principal component analysis. The data transformation is in contrast to steps that perform computations that take the input and generate a derived measure with new information.

ASSET is an automatized test to identify the sequential activations of groups of neurons that repeat in time. The identification of the repeated sequences is possible by computing the intersection matrix. The input spike data is discretized into smaller intervals (bins), and the overlap of neuronal activity at each bin pair is obtained as a matrix. When a sequence of activations exists and repeats in time, a characteristic diagonal structure appears in the matrix.

The ASSET analysis provides a robust statistical test to automatically identify the diagonal structures and to provide the neurons and their activation pattern in each repeated sequence. Overall, the analysis is composed by 6 substeps:

1. Compute the intersection matrix (IMAT) from a set of input spike trains, using a specified bin size to discretize the data.
2. Obtain the probability matrix (PMAT).
3. Obtain the joint probability matrix (JMAT).
4. Extract significant entries in both PMAT and JMAT using specified thresholds, obtaining the mask matrix (MMAT).
5. Obtain the cluster matrix (CMAT) by using DBSCAN to cluster the significant entries in the MMAT to find each diagonal structure. Parameters for DBSCAN control the clustering result. A modified distance metric is used.
6. From the identified clusters (each a single diagonal structure in the IMAT), obtain the neuronal composition and the order of activation, producing the final neuronal activity patterns as output."""@en ;

CAD allows detecting spatio-temporal spike patterns at different time scales, levels of precision, and with arbitrary internal organization. The analysis identifies patterns with different delays between the spikes (within a window determining the minimum and maximum lags), and is performed in two steps using an agglomerative clustering algorithm. First, significant pairwise correlations are identified, which is followed by the clustering procedure that progressively finds interactions of higher order. At each agglomeration step, the method can filter out patterns involving the same neurons, keeping the most significant pattern (significance pruning). In an additional pruning step, assemblies part of a larger assembly can also be eliminated (controlled by the subgroup pruning parameter). The algorithm stops when the detected assemblies reach their maximum size (determined by a parameter). The statistical test assumes independence under non-stationarity and Poisson distribution of the input spike trains."@en ;

The computation of the frequency-domain GC measures is based on two elements: the noise covariance matrix and the spectral transfer matrix. These can be estimated either with parametric or non-parametric methods. For the parametric estimation, an autoregressive model is fit and the Fourier transform of the autoregressive coefficients is used to obtain the spectral transfer matrix. For the non-parametric estimation, the cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix is obtained (using methods for CSD estimation such as multitapering or wavelet), and the CSD matrix is factorized to obtain the noise covariance and spectral transfer matrices."@en ;

Due to non-stationarities in the input spike train and/or its limited duration, it is difficult to accurately estimate the underlying JISI probability distribution. Therefore, a 2D-Gaussian smoothing is applied to the JISI histogram (with a variance determined by parameter). Dithering a spike according to this (smoothed) two-dimensional histogram involves moving the spike along the anti-diagonal of the JISI distribution.

GC is a statistical concept where the future values of a time series are predicted based on its past values and the past values of other time series. GC quantifies bi-directional interactions between the inputs, determining the directional influence from one input to another. For example, with two inputs, GC measures how much the first input influences the second and vice versa (directional GC measure). This provides estimates of the directed connectivity between the inputs. It is also possible to compute associated measures, such as the instantaneous GC (a measure of interdependence between the inputs not accounted by their bi-directional interactions, such as shared neural input) and the total interdependence (the sum of all directional and instantaneous interactions between the inputs). The analysis can be performed in the time or frequency domains, and can take two (bivariate) or more inputs (multivariate)."@en ;

The SPADE analysis takes a set of parallel spike trains as input, and returns significant spatio-temporal neuronal activity (spike) patterns. 

The SPADE method consists of three substeps:

1. Detect all putative patterns in the input data using the frequent item set mining (FIM) algorithm. This step requires the discretization of the input spike train data (binning). The bin size determines the temporal resolution of the analysis.

2. The detected FIM patterns are evaluated for statistical significance, considering the null hypothesis of independence of the spike trains given the modulations by the firing rate. This substep is called Pattern Spectrum Filtering (PSF). For the testing, the patterns are pooled based on their signature: size and occurrence count (non-3d-SPADE) or size, occurrence count and pattern duration (3d-SPADE). The pattern spectrum collects the counts of patterns from each signature. The statistical test is done by a Monte Carlo approach, using spike train surrogates generated from the original data. The final output of this substep is the p-value spectrum, which has the same dimensions as the pattern spectrum. The p-value is computed as the ratio of surrogates containing patterns with that signature to the total number of realizations.

3. Conditional test on the significant patterns to remove patterns arising from the overlap of true pattern spikes and chance spikes (pattern set reduction; PSR)."""@en ;

UE is a statistical technique focused on identifying synchronous activity among neurons, known as unitary events (UEs), which occur more frequently than an expectation based solely on firing rates. The input can contain spike trains from one or more neurons and one or more trials. For the computation, the input spike train data is discretized into small time intervals (bins), and coincidences across the different spike trains are computed. The significance of the number of observed (empirical) coincidences is determined by comparing to an expected number given the firing rates of the neurons. To account for possible non-stationarities in the firing rates, the method uses a sliding temporal window over the data, whose width is specified as parameter. Therefore, a measure of significant spike synchrony (joint surprise) is obtained for each window. The statistical evaluation can be done using either analytical methods or Monte-Carlo testing with surrogate spike data. The output presents the significant coincidences (UE patterns) and the participant neurons."@en ;
