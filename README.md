# Neuroelectrophysiology Analysis Ontology (NEAO)


The NEAO is a collection of controlled vocabularies and concepts to describe the typical processes involved in the analysis of neural activity data acquired using electrophysiology techniques.

The goal of the NEAO is to provide a common framework for annotating neuroelectrophysiology data analysis workflows. This will result in the unambiguous identification of the processes and data elements involved, and also extended semantic information that can be used to reason about the analyses.
