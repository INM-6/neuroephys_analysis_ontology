Electrophysiology is a branch of physiology that studies the electrical properties of biological entities. The studies involve measurements of electric potentials and/or currents, as well as electrical manipulations (e.g. stimuli with electric pulses). Neuroelectrophysiology is the application of electrophysiology techniques to investigate the function of neural tissue.

The neuroelectrophysiology recording is the process of data acquisition, and it usually involves placing electrodes (of several configurations and types) into a preparation of neural tissue. Ultimately, the data will contain a representation of the voltages or currents in the preparation during the recording session, usually as a time series. The analysis requires specific methods to progressively process and transform the recorded data, which ultimately generate meaningful results.

The scope of the NEAO is restricted to represent the neuroelectrophysiology data and analysis processes, standardizing the description of their properties and relationships. The NEAO does not provide a detailed representation of electrophysiology recording techniques, data acquisition methods/equipment, and experimental settings/subjects. The ultimate goal is to ensure a common representation of the data analysis that can be used by tools aiming to provide a detailed and semantically-enriched description of the processes involved."""@en ;
